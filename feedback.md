After the presentation, the comments were.


Very relevant work. Good analysis. You could have spent more time explaining the dataset and preprocessing as that part felt a little rushed. 

For the final, try to include latitude and longitude in the analysis. Since you had a heat map showing regions of crashes, including that in the analysis will be useful. 

Try dividing your data by 1000 to see if that affects performance. Also exclude number of deaths and focus on speed of crash as a feature. 

One thing that was missing was a deep study of the features and how they affect prediction.
