# City of Austin - Car Crash Research Study

*By Luca Comba, Hung Tran and Steven Tran*

After gathering the City of Austin’s data set with over 216,000 reported car crashes from 2010, we were able to examine the relationship between various crash factors and their associated comprehensive costs using multiple machine learning approaches. 

Seven regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, LASSO, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors, were implemented to predict the estimated total comprehensive cost of accidents.

The data set utilized is part of Austin’s Vision Zero initiative and it includes features such as crash severity, vehicle types involved and the speed limit. Our analysis demonstrates that a simpler regression model can achieve the highest prediction accuracy with an R-squared value close to 1, providing valuable insights for urban planning and traffic safety improvements. The findings of this paper could contribute to understanding the economic impact of traffic accidents and can have an important impact on policy decisions for accident preventions.

# Things to improve
- [ ] Reduce overfitting. Maybe by using PCA, LDA, or other dimensionality reduction techniques.
- [ ] Use a different model. Maybe a neural network or a different ensemble model.
- [ ] Include latitude and longitude in the analysis.
